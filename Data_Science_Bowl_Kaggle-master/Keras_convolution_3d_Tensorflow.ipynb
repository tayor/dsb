    "- 3D Lung scans of 1397 patients, consisting of 'stacks' of 2D images for each patient\n",
    "- 26% of the entire Training/Validation set is labelled cancerous, with the remaining labelled non-cancerous\n",
    "\n",
    "From our last project milestone, we have demonstrated the workflow for image preprocessing, and have transformed our set of 512x512x(variable) set of patient lung scan images into single-channel images with dimensions 64x64x64. That workflow has been condensed down into our `load_data` module, which we will import as part of our data ETL pipeline.\n",

It is a popular library that is designed for fast prototyping, through its key features of modularity, minimalism, and extensibility. Using this module, we can rapidly construct the 3D convolutional networks for our image recognition problem.\n",

Since its release, it has enjoyed immense growth and popularity among Deep Learning researchers. One of its key strengths is an out-of-the-box capability to parallelise its computations across clusters, which is a boon for neural network training that remains to be the most significant time bottleneck for complicated Deep Learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen Tensorflow as the backend precisely for this reason. Because of the forseeably expensive computational resources required for training our 3D ConvNet, we plan to deploy our model on Amazon EC2 GPU enabled instances. GPUs have in recent years enjoyed an increase in usage because of Deep Learning, because its architecture allows rapid parallel computations that can much more efficiently solve linear algebra problems that would be much slower with CPUs.\n",

    "This notebook details our first working 3D ConvNet, which we have trialled on the image data from one patient. Our network was able to train and converge using a MacBook Pro. This prototyping serves to demonstrate that we have resolved the issue of memory constraints through our image preprocessing, and we can proceed from here to refine our model, and train it on the entire corpus of our patient data."

    "On the topic of ReLU, the _Deep Learning_ book by Ian Goodfellow et al. states that the theory behind the choice of activation functions for hidden units is as yet not very well developed, and that barring extensive trial and error to prove otherwise, it can be a perfectly reasonable choice to choose ReLU. Although the differentiability of functions is essential to the functioning of back-propagation to train NNs, it is not necessary for such functions to be differentiable at all points; the ReLU for example is non-differentiable at the origin, where there is a discontinuity between the flat and sloping parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Units use the activation function $R(z) = max(0,z)$. It is intuitive to understand: it takes negative inputs and turns them to zero, and keeps the positive inputs. It is attractive because its gradients are both large and consistent for back-propagation. This characteristic is also why neurons should be initialised with small positive bias values: this will give it an initial positive output, and hence a gradient for back-propagation to work on during training. This linear aspect of ReLU renders computations easier as opposed to non-linear activation functions such as Sigmoids.\n",

The 'Convolution' that gives ConvNets their name come from the action of convolving, where each 3x3 matrix slides over the input matrix. After a matrix multiplication with the associated weights. Our ReLU activation function is then applied elementwise to give the output of that layer.\n",
